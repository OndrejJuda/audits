## Summary

Anyone can be an arbiter at the moment. When buyer is arbiter, he can get wait for report and get his money back through buyerAward in resolveDispute. When seller is arbiter, he can get money through resolveDispute immediately.

## Vulnerability Details

There is no check in Escrow.sol constructor, that the arbiter is not buyer nor seller. This poses a threat of one of those addresses set as an arbiter.

If the seller is an arbiter, he can immediately open a dispute and resolve it to get all funds from the Escrow contract without providing a report off-chain.

If the buyer is an arbiter, he can wait for the report and instead of calling confirmReceipt to send funds to the seller, he can initiate a dispute and get back all funds through buyerAward in resolveDispute.

## Impact

If buyer is arbiter, seller won't get money for his report. If seller is arbiter, buyer won't get report and money will be stolen by seller.

## Recommendations

Implement a check in the Escrow constructor to revert when arbiter is buyer or seller.
