## Summary

Uniswap fee is hardcoded in Fees smart contract. This could lead to non-optimal pools being used or even non-existing ones.

## Vulnerability Details

Each pool on Uniswap v3 can have variants with different [fee tiers](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/protocol/fees) - 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.3%, 1%. Fees smart contract has hardcoded value for fee. This could lead to router using pool with less liquidity or wasting gas because the pool does bit exist.

## Impact

Swap could use less liquid pool leading to higher slippage or revert because the pool doesn't exist at all.

## Tools Used

Manual review

## Recommendations

Add second parameter to **sellProfits** function to accept fee value.
