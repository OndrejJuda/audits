# [M-01] Stale price leads to user getting incorrect token amount

## Summary
Users get more/less tokens than they should in current market conditions when price becomes stale.

## Vulnerability Detail
The swap function in [Unitas.sol:208](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/Unitas.sol#L208) uses the current price to calculate the swap amountOut at [Unitas.sol:438](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/Unitas.sol#L439). There is a risk of off-chain price feeders being off and not updating their prices. There is no threshold check for this situation. Price could be outdated, and users could get more/less than they should.

## Impact
Users get more/less tokens than they should in current market conditions.

## Code Snippet
[Unitas.sol:438](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/Unitas.sol#L439)

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Threshold check can be added to make the [XOracle.sol:49](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/XOracle.sol#L49) and [XOracle.sol:58](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/XOracle.sol#L58) functions revert if the price timestamp is too old. This would protect both users from getting less tokens and the protocol from minting/sending more tokens than it should.
